          <h2 class="pre">WHAT MAKES US PREFERRED CHOICE</h2>
          <h3 class="col">1- <b><u>Property Price:</b></u>
            The first step in selecting a house or a flat is to fix a budget. It makes it easier to shortlist a house if you know how much you are willing to spend on it. Compare the price of the property in question with the ones surrounding it from various builders to get an idea if the builder has offered you a genuine quotation. There are many ways where you can get a comparative of properties in the area you are looking. Portal listings, brokers of the area or newspaper listings are such sources.

            2- <b><u>Flat’s Carpet Area:</b></u>
            Usually, a property’s area or the super built-up area that is listed is the entire area including shafts, elevator space, stairs, thickness of walls and others. However, carpet area is the actual area within the walls of the flat. This are can be 30 per cent lesser than the built-up area or the area used to calculate the price of the property. In some cases, when a floor is shared between two owners, the price of the common spaces are shared between the two.
            
            <br><br>3- <b><u>Land Record:</b></u>
            The land on which your flat is built is very crucial. You must research about the soil quality and topography of the land on which the house is constructed. The plot should also be clear of all dues and be registered. Before buying a house, the title deed must be verified and checked in detail. The deed gives all details on the rights, ownership and obligations towards the property.
            
            <br><br>4- <b><u>Legal Check of Property:</b></u>
            Ensure the property is legally authorized to be constructed on the plot it stands on. The developer should have approvals and NOCs from Area development authorities, water supply and sewage boards, electricity boards and Municipal Corporation. However if you are taking a home loan, the concerned bank will validate your property documents before loan sanction.</h3>
